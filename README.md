**TRANSFER-LEARNING-AND-KNOWLEDGE-DISTILLATION-for-CHEST-X-RAY-CLASSIFICATION**
This project demonstrates a powerful and efficient deep learning approach for chest X-ray classification. It leverages a combination of Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation to create a high-performing and lightweight model, which is ideal for real-world medical applications where data is limited and computational resources may be constrained.
