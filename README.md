
**TRANSFER-LEARNING-AND-KNOWLEDGE-DISTILLATION-for-CHEST-X-RAY-CLASSIFICATION**

This project uses two powerful and efficient deep learning approaches for chest X-ray classification. A combination of Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation to create a high-performing and lightweight model. This makes the approach particularly suitable for deployment in low-resource healthcare settings, where computational efficiency and reliability are crucial.
