TRANSFER-LEARNING-AND-KNOWLEDGE-DISTILLATION-for-CHEST-X-RAY-CLASSIFICATION
This project demonstrates a powerful and efficient deep learning approach for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It leverages Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation to create a high-performing and lightweight model, which is ideal for real-world medical applications where data is limited and computational resources may be constrained.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust system for the automated classification of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It tackles two critical challenges prevalent in medical AI:

Data Scarcity: Training a deep learning model from scratch on limited labeled medical data can lead to poor performance and overfitting.

Deployment Constraints: Large, high-performance models are often too slow or resource-intensive for deployment on edge devices or in clinical settings with limited computational power.

Our solution addresses these challenges by employing a two-stage approach:

Transfer Learning: We fine-tune a pre-trained, large-scale model (the "teacher") to achieve high accuracy on the classification task. This leverages the extensive knowledge the model has already learned from a massive, general-purpose dataset.

Knowledge Distillation: We then use the knowledge from this large teacher model to train a smaller, more efficient "student" model. The student model learns to mimic the teacher's nuanced predictions, resulting in a lightweight model that retains a high degree of performance, making it suitable for deployment.

Features
Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning of state-of-the-art architectures (e.g., ResNet-50) on a chest X-ray dataset.

Knowledge Distillation: Implementation of a distillation pipeline to compress a large teacher model into a compact student model.

Model Compression: The final student model is highly efficient, making it suitable for deployment on mobile or embedded devices.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed comparison of the performance of the baseline, teacher, and student models using relevant medical diagnosis metrics (e.g., AUC-ROC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall).

Baseline Model: A simple, custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is included to serve as a benchmark for comparison.

Dataset
This project uses the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset, available on Kaggle. It contains images labeled as either Normal or Pneumonia. The dataset exhibits a class imbalance, which is a realistic challenge in medical datasets. This imbalance is handled through data augmentation and is an important consideration in the model's evaluation metrics.
